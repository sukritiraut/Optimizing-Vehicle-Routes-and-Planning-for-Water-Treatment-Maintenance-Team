# All instructions, code comments, etc. contained within this notebook are part of the assignment instructions.
# Portions of this file will auto-graded in Gradescope using different sets of parameters / data to ensure that values are not
# hard-coded.
#
# Instructions:  Implement all methods in this file that have a return
# value of 'NotImplemented'. See the documentation within each method for specific details, including
# the expected return value
#
# Helper Functions:
# You are permitted to write additional helper functions/methods or use additional instance variables within
# the `Graph` class or `TMDbAPIUtils` class so long as the originally included methods work as required.
#
# Use:
# The `Graph` class  is used to represent and store the data for the TMDb co-actor network graph.  This class must
# also provide some basic analytics, i.e., number of nodes, edges, and nodes with the highest degree.
#
# The `TMDbAPIUtils` class is used to retrieve Actor/Movie data using themoviedb.org API.  We have provided a few necessary methods
# to test your code w/ the API, e.g.: get_movie_cast(), get_movie_credits_for_person().  You may add additional
# methods and instance variables as desired (see Helper Functions).
#
# The data that you retrieve from the TMDb API is used to build your graph using the Graph class.  After you build your graph using the
# TMDb API data, use the Graph class write_edges_file & write_nodes_file methods to produce the separate nodes and edges
# .csv files for submission to Gradescope.
#
# While building the co-actor graph, you will be required to write code to expand the graph by iterating
# through a portion of the graph nodes and finding similar artists using the TMDb API. We will not grade this code directly
# but will grade the resulting graph data in your nodes and edges .csv files.

# BUILDING YOUR GRAPH
#
# Working with the API:  See use of http.request: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#examples
#
# Using TMDb's API, build a co-actor network for the actor's/actress' highest rated movies
# In this graph, each node represents an actor
# An edge between any two nodes indicates that the two actors/actresses acted in a movie together
# i.e., they share a movie credit.
# e.g., An edge between Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Downey Jr. indicates that they have acted in one
# or more movies together.
#
# For this assignment, we are interested in a co-actor network of highly rated movies; specifically,
# we only want the top 3 co-actors in each movie credit of an actor having a vote average >= 8.0.
# Build your co-actor graph on the actor 'Laurence Fishburne' w/ person_id 2975.
#
# You will need to add extra functions or code to accomplish this.  We will not directly call or explicitly grade your
# algorithm. We will instead measure the correctness of your output by evaluating the data in your nodes.csv and edges.csv files.
#
# GRAPH SIZE
# With each iteration of your graph build, the number of nodes and edges grows approximately at an exponential rate.
# Our testing indicates growth approximately equal to e^2x.
# Since the TMDB API is a live database, the number of nodes / edges in the final graph will vary slightly depending on when
# you execute your graph building code. We take this into account by rebuilding the solution graph every few days and
# updating the auto-grader.  We establish a bound for lowest & highest encountered numbers of nodes and edges with a
# margin of +/- 100 for nodes and +/- 150 for edges.  e.g., The allowable range of nodes is set to:
#
# Min allowable nodes = min encountered nodes - 100
# Max allowable nodes = max allowable nodes + 100
#
# e.g., if the minimum encountered nodes = 507 and the max encountered nodes = 526, then the min/max range is 407-626
# The same method is used to calculate the edges with the exception of using the aforementioned edge margin.

# END BUILD CO-ACTOR NETWORK
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exception handling and best practices
# - You should use the param 'language=en-US' in all API calls to avoid encoding issues when writing data to file.
# - If the actor name has a comma char ',' it should be removed to prevent extra columns from being inserted into the .csv file
# - Some movie_credits do not return cast data. Handle this situation by skipping these instances.
# - While The TMDb API does not have a rate-limiting scheme in place, consider that making hundreds / thousands of calls
#   can occasionally result in timeout errors. If you continue to experience 'ConnectionRefusedError : [Errno 61] Connection refused',
#   - wait a while and then try again.  It may be necessary to insert periodic sleeps when you are building your graph.
